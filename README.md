## Game Rules
The player controls a **snake** moving on the **board**. There are **apples** (red squares) on the board, which, when eaten, **increase the length of the snake**. When one apple is eaten, a new one is randomly generated on the board. The goal of the game is to achieve **the longest possible snake**.

 Collision with the edges of the board or with the snake itself **ends the game**.
