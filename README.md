# Snake Game

Author: Adrian Szwaczyk

## Game Rules
The player controls a snake moving on the board. There are apples (red squares) on the board, which, when eaten, increase the length of the snake. When one apple is eaten, a new one is randomly generated on the board. The goal of the game is to achieve the longest possible snake. Collision with the edges of the board or with the snake itself ends the game.
